==================
easygui_qt API
==================

*Note:* if you are reading this documentation on "ReadTheDocs" site,
it will not appear as it should.

Most functions in easygui_qt are wrapped by decorators so that a
PyQt application can
automatically be started.  As a result, only a generic signature for
each function appears below; this is due to a limitation of readthedocs
since the signature is available when using Python's help() system.
However, by clicking on "view source", it is possible to view the signature
if needed.
